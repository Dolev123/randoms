# Solution

The second part was a lot trickier than I thought it would.   
I needed to use a reference solution to check for bugs. thanks `razimantv` for writing a simple one on github.   

reference material:
- `man awk`
- [The AWK Programming Language](https://ia903404.us.archive.org/0/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf)
- [razimantv's solution](https://github.com/razimantv/AdventOfCode2023/blob/main/1/2.py)
